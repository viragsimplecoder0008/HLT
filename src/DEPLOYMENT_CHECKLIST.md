# üöÄ Deployment Checklist

## Current Status

You've just added **Groups** and **SuperAdmin** features to your HLT app. Here's what you need to deploy:

---

## ‚úÖ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy the Edge Function (REQUIRED)

The backend has new endpoints for Groups and SuperAdmin. You **must** deploy the Edge Function:

```bash
supabase functions deploy make-server-8daf44f4
```

**What this does:**
- Deploys all group endpoints (`/groups`, `/invites`, etc.)
- Deploys all superadmin endpoints (`/superadmin/*`)
- Auto-creates superadmin accounts (viraj@hlt.app, admin@hlt.app)
- Initializes the backend with new functionality

**Expected output:**
```
Deploying function make-server-8daf44f4...
Deployed function make-server-8daf44f4 to https://hbabranmwzppeuyczvlv.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-8daf44f4
```

---

### Step 2: Deploy the Frontend

Commit and push your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Groups and SuperAdmin features"
git push origin main
```

**What this does:**
- Netlify automatically detects the push
- Builds the updated app
- Deploys to https://help-learn-thank.netlify.app

**Expected time:** 2-3 minutes

---

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

#### Test Groups Feature

1. Go to https://help-learn-thank.netlify.app
2. Sign in with your account
3. Click **Groups** tab
4. Try creating a group
5. If you see the group created successfully ‚úÖ - Backend is deployed!
6. If you see 404 errors ‚ùå - Backend not deployed yet (go back to Step 1)

#### Test SuperAdmin Feature

1. Sign in with username: `viraj`, password: `SuperAdmin123!`
2. You should see a **Role Selection** screen
3. Choose **SuperAdmin**
4. Click the **Admin** tab
5. You should see the SuperAdmin dashboard
6. If you see data ‚úÖ - SuperAdmin is working!
7. If you see errors ‚ùå - Check backend deployment

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Error: "404 Not Found" on Groups endpoints

**Cause:** Edge Function not deployed yet

**Solution:**
```bash
supabase functions deploy make-server-8daf44f4
```

### Error: "403 Forbidden" on SuperAdmin endpoints

**Cause:** User doesn't have superadmin privileges

**Solution:** 
- Sign in with `viraj` or `admin` username
- Select "SuperAdmin" role when prompted
- If still not working, redeploy Edge Function

### Error: "Role selection not appearing"

**Cause:** User doesn't have multiple roles

**Solution:**
- SuperAdmin feature only shows role selection for users with `roles: ['user', 'superadmin']`
- Regular users won't see role selection (this is expected)
- Only viraj@hlt.app and admin@hlt.app have multiple roles

### Error: "Can't create groups"

**Checklist:**
1. ‚úÖ Edge Function deployed?
2. ‚úÖ Signed in with valid account?
3. ‚úÖ Check browser console for errors
4. ‚úÖ Check Edge Function logs: `supabase functions logs make-server-8daf44f4`

---

## üìã Post-Deployment Tasks

### 1. Change SuperAdmin Passwords ‚ö†Ô∏è

**IMPORTANT:** The default passwords are public. Change them immediately!

```bash
# Sign in as viraj
# Go to Profile ‚Üí Change password (when feature is added)
# Or use Supabase dashboard to reset password
```

Default credentials:
- Username: `viraj` | Password: `SuperAdmin123!`
- Username: `admin` | Password: `SuperAdmin123!`

### 2. Test All Features

- [ ] Daily check-in works
- [ ] Create a group
- [ ] Invite a user to group
- [ ] Accept invite (as another user)
- [ ] View group leaderboard
- [ ] Edit group (as admin)
- [ ] Remove member (as admin)
- [ ] Ban user (as admin)
- [ ] SuperAdmin dashboard loads
- [ ] SuperAdmin unified leaderboard shows data
- [ ] SuperAdmin can delete users/groups

### 3. Create Test Users

Create a few test users to populate the leaderboards:

```bash
# User 1
curl -X POST https://hbabranmwzppeuyczvlv.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-8daf44f4/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
  -d '{"username":"testuser1","password":"password123"}'

# User 2
curl -X POST https://hbabranmwzppeuyczvlv.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-8daf44f4/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
  -d '{"username":"testuser2","password":"password123"}'
```

## üîç Checking Logs

### Edge Function Logs

```bash
supabase functions logs make-server-8daf44f4 --tail
```

Look for:
- `SuperAdmin viraj initialized successfully`

- Any errors

### Browser Console

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
