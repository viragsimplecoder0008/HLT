The system will automatically:
1. Check the "No, not today" checkbox
2. Clear the text field
3. Show a confirmation message

## Technical Implementation

```

### Negative Response Detection
Uses regex patterns to detect negative responses:
```typescript
const negativePatterns = [
  /^no$/,
  /^nope$/,
  /^not today$/,
  /^no i did not$/,
  /^no i didn't$/,
  // ... more patterns
];
```
